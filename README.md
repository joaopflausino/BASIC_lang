# BASIC Programming language

**BASIC** is a simple, number-centric programming language created using Python. This language allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Designed for educational purposes, it is easy to understand and perfect for beginners who want to learn how programming languages work at a basic level.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Simple Syntax:
Commands consist solely of mathematical operations on numbers.

Installation
To use BASIC, ensure you have Python installed. Then clone this repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-lang.git
cd basic-lang
```

Usage
To run BASIC, use the following command:

```console
python basic.py
```

Example
Write a simple BASIC program:

```basic
5 + 10
20 - 4
3 * 7
9 / 3
```

Run the program, and you will get:
```basic
15
16
21
3.0
```

Language Syntax
BASIC syntax is intentionally simple. Each line contains a mathematical operation on two numbers. Currently supported operators are:

+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
Example usage:

```basic
number1 + number2
number1 - number2
number1 * number2
number1 / number2
```
